## About the Book

Artificial intelligence is fundamentally reshaping the practice of UX design. Nearly half of UX designers have begun using AI to experiment with new design strategies, yet many find themselves uncertain about how to integrate these tools effectively into their work.

This guide is built on a simple premise: **AI will not replace UX designers, but designers who effectively leverage AI will have significant advantages over those who don't.**

The goal is not to turn you into an AI engineer. Rather, it's to help you understand how AI can augment your existing skills, accelerate your workflows, and enable you to create better products for users.

## What You'll Learn

The book is organized into seven parts covering the full spectrum of AI-enhanced UX work:

| Part | Focus | Chapters |
|------|-------|----------|
| **I** | Understanding the New Landscape | The AI revolution, core concepts, evolving designer roles |
| **II** | AI-Enhanced User Research | Automating analysis, AI personas, research materials |
| **III** | AI-Powered Ideation & Design | Brainstorming, visual design, UX writing with AI |
| **IV** | Prototyping & Implementation | Rapid prototyping, design-to-code, AI-assisted reviews |
| **V** | Testing & Iteration | AI-moderated testing, feedback analysis, personalization |
| **VI** | Designing AI-Powered Products | Mental models, transparency, ethics, error handling |
| **VII** | Career Development | Portfolio building, essential skills, interview preparation |

Plus four appendices with practical resources: AI glossary, tool comparisons, prompt library, and a career transition checklist.

## Who This Is For

- Junior and mid-career UX designers looking to transition to AI-enhanced roles
- Designers already using tools like ChatGPT or Midjourney who want to deepen their practice
- Anyone concerned about how AI might change their design job and wanting to get ahead
